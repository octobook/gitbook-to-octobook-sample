# More About User Input

We only covered buttons and text fields, but there are other crazier inputs that you will need eventually.

So if you want to see examples of radio buttons and check boxes, visit [the Elm examples page](http://elm-lang.org/examples) which has a bunch of small examples you can mess around with. It is all variations on stuff we have learned in this tutorial already, so playing with these examples is a great way to practice and become more comfortable with what you have learned so far. Maybe try incorporating check boxes into the form example?

That said, I want to keep up the momentum of this tutorial and keep introducing new concepts, so next we will be looking at how to work with things like HTTP and web sockets!
